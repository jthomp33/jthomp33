I'm currently pursuing a **BA in Sociology and Peace Studies** with a **minor in Data Science** at the University of Notre Dame, where I work as a research assistant for leading faculty in religious studies, ethics, and environmental justice. My work has been presented at the American Sociological Association and internationally through FLARE and Tufts.
